EVTOPTEFKA8;People of the [local_burial_tomb.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] lets sing their deeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFFKA8;I pray that the hero's name will be known for many generations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFKA9;Inspired by [hero_person.GetName], you have tried to emulate their great deeds. Many people have already begun to speak highly of you as a potential new protege of the late hero. Whether their feats of cunning or strength , the people of [hero_person.PrimaryTitle.GetName] wonder whether the spirit of the Hero emunates from you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA9;May I do a fraction of their deeds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA10;[target_burial_site.GetName] is a well known traveling spot for people wishing to see the tomb of the Hero [target_burial_site.province_saint.GetFirstName]. I have never cared much for the hero [target_burial_site.province_saint.GetFirstName] nor [offended_burial_site_owner.GetTitledFirstName], and an opportunity to grab the valuables of the tomb has offered itself. But is it worth the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA10;No, I rather not offend the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA10;Perhaps I can find something of worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA11;Entering the tomb of [target_burial_site.GetName], I began to observe the surrounding guaging the amount of treasures I can plunder for my own gain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA11;I should pick a few shinies and make haste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA11;I should plunder this tomb bare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA12;The caretakers of the tomb have caught wind of your activities and quickly wrestle you to the ground. You curse the gods for your misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA12;For shame, I've been caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA13;The burial site of The §YHero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]§! at [target_burial_site.GetName] has been plundered, and has been left a pile of rubble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA14;My men have come across the burial site of some great "hero" of the pathetic [pillaged_hellenic.Religion.GetGroupName] [pillaged_hellenic.GetTitledFirstName]. This could be a chance to show them how we treat their unmanly ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA14;Take everything of value, and leave nothing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA14;We are not petty like them, we will leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA16;I shall venture to the tomb of a local hero on my way to the holy places! Perhaps I can learn many things from their deeds, as I learn more about the divine's role in our lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA16_1;I shall visit [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA16_2;I shall visit [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA16_3;I shall visit [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDFKA16_3;I shall visit [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA17;Traveling along a well kept path along the forested hills of [e_greek_empire.GetName], passing by many plain cottages as you make your way to the various holy places that dot the serene hillsides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA17;Onwards I go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA18;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA18_ALT;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA18_ALT_2;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA18_ALT_3;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA18;Friendly company? That sounds like a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA18;A proper hero forges their own path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA19;I am suddenly met by a couple of rough looking fellows, as I proceed through the forest. The leader gives me a toothy grin and asking for "donations", for the service he and his men are doing in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA19;It is probably easier to just pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA19;I will show them who needs protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA20;The days have been long, but the journey not without joy. By my own estimates, I should be halfway to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] by now. I am not used to such long travels like these, but it has been a nice change of pace from the palace affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA20;I wonder what awaits me in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA21;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling bards. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA21_ALT;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling entertainers. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWoman] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA21;That sounds like a nice suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA21;What kind of [Root.GetManWoman] do you think I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA22;It has been a long day of traveling when I come across a burning homestead. I had hoped to find a place to stay the night, but these people are clearly in dire need of help to stop the flames from engulfing the entire place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to help out these poor people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to continue my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to grab some valuables while they are busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA23;The rain is pouring down and I am desperately looking for a shelter, when I come across a small simple shrine and the hut of its caretaker. The modest man welcomes me inside, hangs my soaking clothes over the fire to dry and gives me a hot meal. When he mentions that it probably will not stop raining for a couple of days, I wonder if I have time to wait for that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA23;It is better to rest a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBFKA23;A real hero would not let a bit of bad weather stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPFKA23_TT;You start feeling ill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA24;I find myself in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] before I know it. It has been a long journey through the wilderness, to once more see people is a nice change. As I walk through the city streets, I compare it to my own lands, and how the people have dealt with their own challenges. I find my way to the burial site of [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetName] as quickly as possible, that is what I am here for after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA24;I wonder what the tomb will look like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA25_A;The whole area is filled with people, looking like they come from all the different corners of [e_greek_empire.GetName]. I see another [Root.Culture.GetName] looking at me, and giving me a small nod before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] disappears in the crowd. I never knew  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] was this popular or well known. Though it is stressful, I finally get my moment to stand in front of the gates of the tomb, and feel the shining aura of the hero who resides within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA25_B;There is a couple of other travelers around, but they all look relatively local to the area. I walk over to the tomb, and look upon a simple mural of the hero on the wall. as well as a stele commemorating the deeds of the hero. It has been a long journey to get to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], and I finally get to look upon the glorious burial site of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA25_C;The burial site is completely devoid of people, not a single soul to be seen. I look around for it, almost sure I am at the wrong place for a moment, and then I see the simple unmarked tomb. It looks overgrown and deserted, and I take some time to tidy the place up before I finally sit down in prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. It is almost like  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] is here with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA25;I will remember this moment for the rest of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA25;Was.. Was this it? What a disappointing end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFKA25;What a journey it has been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA26;Your trip to the tomb has come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA26;It was a good journey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
