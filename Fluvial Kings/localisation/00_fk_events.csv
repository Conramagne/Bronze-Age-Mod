EVTDESCFKP1;You have decided to call upon the gods of the [Root.Religion.GetFullName] pantheon in exultation and loud prayer, and the divines have recieved you plea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP100;It begins as a feeling, as when one slowly awakens from a dream. You feel a hand of light pass through you and for an instant you feel the euphoria of a youth in love or a child for their parent. A god has paid notice to you, and now works those many small miracles that improve one’s life. Stretching your limbs, you shout for joy towards the heavens. You are blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP101;Despair! The gods have ignored your request for a blessing, your devotion to them must not have been great enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP201;As ruler, you of course have the option to carry out the sacrifice yourself. The prize bull is led into the throng signalling the beginning of the liturgy and the sacrifice. The priests nod, they are ready to initiate the ritual, you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP201;...say the prayers yourself and take the knife to the offerings throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKP201;...decide to let the priests handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP202;You recite the archaic words flawlessly with correct intonation and volume, deftly you slide the razor-thin blade in and out of the bulls neck, it tramps, shudders, and lies down. The oldest priest gives you a strong nod as the initiates frantically bend down to collect the precious blood and start the fire upon  the altar. The gods will be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP202;For the Glory of the gods, and my house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP204;The priests cry out the correct exultations as the prize bull is led into the throng. The oldest among them finishes the prayer and without blinking opens the beasts throat with the flint knife. As it thrashes and dies the younger members of the congregation begin to light the altar fire and prepare to joint the bull. A successful sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP204;As to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP203;You turn the sacred words into a stuttering muddle, halfway through you accidently recite a childhood prayer and have to begin again. Your cut was too shallow as well, the nervous bull tosses its head and knocks you to the ground. You shout a blasphemous curse and arise covered in filth and blood, and then the crowd begins to laugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP203;Oh, what transgression have I committed? Perhaps it was the wine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP205;It begins well enough, the prayers were recited more or less correctly by the chosen priest who unfortunately displays the signs of a drunk and nervous man. But as the prize bull is led out it not only trods on an old man's foot but breaks through the crowd and gallops away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP205;Catch it! Catch it you fools! Gods, the day is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP302;The day begins horribly, you are gripped with anxiety and nausea arising from a night of feverish half-sleep. You flee the shaded corridors for the garden, where even the wind in your ears seems to mock you and the undersides of shrubs are home to grinning demons. You are accursed by a vengeful god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP302;Lo, how strange are the ways of the gods. I need a sacrifice to appease them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
