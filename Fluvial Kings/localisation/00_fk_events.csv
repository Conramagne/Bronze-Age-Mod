EVTOPTCFKP200;HAH, what am I, some poor country yokel? Spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP201;As ruler, you of course have the option to carry out the sacrifice yourself. The prize bull is led into the throng signalling the beginning of the liturgy and the sacrifice. The priests nod, they are ready to initiate the ritual, you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBFKP201;...decide to let the priests handle it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP202;You recite the archaic words flawlessly with correct intonation and volume, deftly you slide the razor-thin blade in and out of the bulls neck, it tramps, shudders, and lies down.

EVTOPTAFKP202;For the glory of the gods, and my house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP204;The priests cry out the correct exultations as the prize bull is led into the throng.

EVTOPTAFKP204;As to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP203;You turn the sacred words into a stuttering muddle, halfway through you accidently recite a childhood prayer and have to begin again. Your cut was too shallow as well, the nervous bull tosses its head and knocks you to the ground. You shout a blasphemous curse and arise covered in filth and blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP203;Oh, what transgression have I committed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKP205;It begins well enough, the prayers were recited more or less correctly by the chosen priest who unfortunately displays the signs of a drunk and nervous man. But as the prize bull is led out it not only trods on an old man's foot but breaks free and gallops away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKP205;Catch it! Catch it you fools! Gods, the day is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKP302;The day begins horribly, you are gripped with anxiety and nausea arising from a night of feverish half-sleep.

EVTTITLEFKA7;A Hero has Ascended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA7;[hero_person.GetDynName] lived a glorious life, truly following the example of [hero_person.Religion.GetHighGodName]. [hero_person.GetSheHeCap] passed on [hero_person.GetDeathDate], and people have long wondered if [hero_person.GetSheHe] would be considered a hero of the [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName] people or not. After many worshippers graced the tomb of [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick], it has been popularly declared that [hero_person.GetFirstNameWithNick] as a [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName] who has indeed ascended into a state of apotheosis, celebrated by the people of [hero_capital.GetName] as well as by the [hero_person.Religion.GetGroupName] world as a whole.  \n\nWe can only wish to follow [hero_person.GetHerHis] example, and become worthy people in the eyes of [hero_person.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTFFKA8;I pray that the hero's name will be known for many generations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFKA9;Inspired by [hero_person.GetName], you have tried to emulate their great deeds. Many people have already begun to speak highly of you as a potential new protege of the late hero.

EVTOPTAFKA9;May I do a fraction of their deeds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA10;[target_burial_site.GetName] is a well known traveling spot for people wishing to see the tomb of the Hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName]. I have never cared much for the hero [target_burial_site.province_hero.GetFirstName] nor [offended_burial_site_owner.GetTitledFirstName], and an opportunity to grab the valuables of the tomb has offered itself. But is it worth the risk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA10;No, I rather not offend the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA10;Perhaps I can find something of worth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA11;Entering the tomb of [target_burial_site.GetName], I began to observe the surrounding guaging the amount of treasures I can plunder for my own gain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA11;I should pick a few shinies and make haste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA11;I should plunder this tomb bare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA14;My men have come across the burial site of some great "hero" of the pathetic [pillaged_hellenic.Religion.GetGroupName] [pillaged_hellenic.GetTitledFirstName]. This could be a chance to show them how we treat their uncivilized ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA14;Take everything of value, and leave nothing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA14;We are not petty like them, we will leave it be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA17;Traveling along a well kept path along the forested hills, passing by many plain cottages as you make your way to the various holy places that dot the serene hillsides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA17;Onwards I go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA18;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA18_ALT;I come across a group of travelers, who are also traveling to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], to ask for the blessing of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick]. Traveling together could be beneficial and safer, though probably somewhat slower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA18;Friendly company? That sounds like a nice change of pace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA18;A proper hero forges their own path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA19;I am suddenly met by a couple of rough looking fellows, as I proceed through the forest. The leader gives me a toothy grin and asking for "donations", for the service he and his men are doing in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA19;It is probably easier to just pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA19;I will show them who needs protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA20;The days have been long, but the journey not without joy. By my own estimates, I should be halfway to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] by now. I am not used to such long travels like these, but it has been a nice change of pace from the palace affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA20;I wonder what awaits me in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA21;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling bards. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWomanOpp] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA21_ALT;I come across a group of caravans, filled with the laughter and joy of a group of traveling entertainers. As day turns to night, I enjoy the company of the group. A particularly beautiful [Root.GetManWoman] is teasing me, and invites me to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA21;That sounds like a nice suggestion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA21;What kind of [Root.GetManWoman] do you think I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA22;It has been a long day of traveling when I come across a burning homestead. I had hoped to find a place to stay the night, but these people are clearly in dire need of help to stop the flames from engulfing the entire place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to help out these poor people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to continue my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFKA22;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] calls upon me to grab some valuables while they are busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA23;The rain is pouring down and I am desperately looking for a shelter, when I come across a small simple shrine and the hut of its caretaker. The modest man welcomes me inside, hangs my soaking clothes over the fire to dry and gives me a hot meal. When he mentions that it probably will not stop raining for a couple of days, I wonder if I have time to wait for that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA23;It is better to rest a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBFKA23;A real hero would not let a bit of bad weather stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPFKA23_TT;You start feeling ill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA24;I find myself in [pilgrimage_destination.GetName] before I know it. It has been a long journey through the wilderness, to once more see people is a nice change. As I walk through the city streets, I compare it to my own lands, and how the people have dealt with their own challenges. I find my way to the burial site of [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetName] as quickly as possible, that is what I am here for after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA24;I wonder what the tomb will look like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA25_A;The whole area is filled with people, looking like they come from all the different corners of the world I see another [Root.Culture.GetName] looking at me, and giving me a small nod before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] disappears in the crowd. I never knew [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] was this popular or well known. Though it is stressful, I finally get my moment to stand in front of the gates of the tomb, and feel the shining aura of the hero who resides within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA25_B;There is a couple of other travelers around, but they all look relatively local to the area. I walk over to the tomb, and look upon a simple mural of the hero on the wall. as well as a stele commemorating the deeds of the hero. It has been a long journey to get to [pilgrimage_destination.GetName], and I finally get to look upon the glorious burial site of  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFKA25_C;The burial site is completely devoid of people, not a single soul to be seen. I look around for it, almost sure I am at the wrong place for a moment, and then I see the simple unmarked tomb. It looks overgrown and deserted, and I take some time to tidy the place up before I finally sit down in prayer to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. It is almost like  [pilgrimage_destination.province_hero.GetFirstNameWithNick] is here with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAFKA25;I will remember this moment for the rest of my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKA25;Was... Was this it? What a disappointing end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFKA25;What a journey it has been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKA26;Your trip to the tomb has come to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKA26;It was a good journey...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCFKM6;I have just inherited the land of [From.GetName] from [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. Now I must decide on how I shall distribute it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKM6;A member of the capital nobility will be just fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFKM6_TT;You will be able to choose their successor if they stay a viceroy, however [capital_county.Culture.GetName] provinces in the region will be upset if they are not of their culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFKM6;I trust one of my blood to rule [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFKM6;A [capital_county.Culture.GetName] noble will be able to rule best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTDFKM6;I shall make this decision later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Trojan War Events###########
EVTTITLETW2;The Trojan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW2;"And there in the midst strode powerful Agamemnon, like a bull rising head and shoulders over the herds, a royal bull rearing over his flocks of driven cattle."\n\nAgamemnon, [Root.GetTitle] of Mykenae, how well you serve your brother through your leonine strength! Bound by the oath you made to Tundáreos, you take up arms against the Trojans. However, your journey has been fraught with tragedy. Marred by bad winds, you were forced to sacrifice your daughter, Iphigenia, in order to be allowed passage to Troy, greatly angering your wife Klutaimnistra. O, how great the sons of Atreus are, but how accursed their blood is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW2;"But his turn next - Menelaos reared with a bronze lance and a prayer to Father Zeus: 'Zeus, King, give me revenge, he wronged me first!'"\n\nWrathful Menelaos, husband to the great beauty Helen, how have you been cursed in such a way! Through the help of the goddess Aphrodite, Paris abducted your wife, and incurred your fury. No sooner shall you die by your own sword than allow this transgression to pass. The rage of lions swirl within your head, and all you think of is vengeance. However, this question still stands - What shall you say to her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCTW2;"And wrath seized Telamon, and he rushed upon Tiphys son of Hagnias, and his eyes sparkled like flashes of ravening flame."\n\nMighty Telamon, you are not only father to the strong Aías, but a man of glory in your own right. Though the heroes of this generation swear to be great enough to breach the god-forged walls of Troy, you have already entered the city a plunderer, and you have taken a princess of your own from the Trojans. Though you are thought of as too old to throw yourself in front of Trojan arms once again, you have great hope in the belief that your son may receive glory for your house in your stead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESDCTW2;"Nestor, horseman of Gerene, then addressed them. 'Shame on you,' he cried, 'to stay talking here like children, when you should fight like men.'"\n\nKing Nestor, though your days as a warrior are far behind you, you still prove useful through your knowledge on strategy and oration. The great Achaean kings come to you for military advice, and, wise in words, you surely give them strategies directly from Athenâ. Though your son Antílokhos will be on the battlefield, it is you for which acclaim will surely fall for your military cunning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCETW2;"The famous spearman Idomeneus led the men of Krete, who held Knossos, and the well-walled city of Gortyn."\n\nGreat Idomeneus, friend of Aías and [Root.GetTitle] of Krete. You rule over such a storied land, with both cities of modern walls and of old stone rubble. Though relatively far from many of the troubles of the mainland, you still have taken the same pledge as your Achaean brothers, and will fight on the same battlefield. Great honor will befall you, if the gods permit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFTW2;"Peleus said only this: - 'My son! be brave!'"\n\nPeleus, great hero and king of Phthia, and father to Akhilleus, the greatest of the Achaeans. Though exiled for the murder of his brother Phokos, Peleus proved himself on the battlefield, was purified from his crime, became [Root.GetTitle] of Phthia, and successfully courted the Nereid Themis. Your wife Themis has blessed your son with near invunerability, with the knowledge that he will live either a long and uneventful or short and glorious life. Too old to fight in the Trojan War, you send Akhilleus in your stead. May he win glory for you and your house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCGTW2;"He was bred in rocky Ithake, and he's quick at every treachery under the sun, the man of twists and turns."\n\nOdusseús, the trickster of Ithake. Although you are versed in arms like all good Achaean men, your mind is your true weapon. Favored by the strategist Athenâ, the Achaeans hail your tongue as the sharpest, and your mind as the quickest. As the one who devised the Oath of Tundáreos, you feel as if you are not only defending your honor through accepting Menelaos' call, but you are defending your honor as one endowed with the wisdom to forge such deals among Achaeans. Odusseús, may Athenâ find you well on the battlefield! And may Poseidaon find you well on the seas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHTW2;"The spearhead sliced right through to the flesh, And when Diomedes pulled it out, Ares yelled, so loud you would have thought ten thousand warriors had shouted at once..."\n\nGreat Diomedes, [Root.GetTitle] of a third of Argos, and a favorite of the great strategist Athenâ. The standard of a great hero, your strength and strategic knowledge is only bested by your piety and your respect to the gods. Though you are young, you are respected among even the most experienced of Achaeans, and are valued as one of their finest, rivaling even Akhilleus. This war may be your most difficult test as a hero, with many tribulations ahead. Diomedes, advised by the gods themselves, are you truly ready to face them on the battlefield?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW2;"Friends and fighting men of the Danaans, henchmen of Ares, be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour."\n\n[Root.GetBestName], you have been called to arms by Menelaos, [Root.GetTitle] of Sparta, in order to fulfill your oath and defend Helen of Sparta, who has been abducted by Paris of Troy. You have heard many whispers about the inpenetrable walls of Troy, built by gods in atonement, but now you and your men must board ships and see if the rumors were true. Everlasting glory may be won on these days of battle, and songs may ever be sung of your triumphs. But be wary, as the fates of men are fickle, and the Trojans have great heroes of their own. Though you may face many tribulations, go on, [Root.GetFirstName], and win glory for your house!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW2;To Troy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW2_TT;As you spend time in the battlefield and at Troy, you may encounter certain events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW3;The Trojan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW3;"'Let [Root.GetFirstName] bleed! If yet you thirst for more, bleed all of his sons, and let Ilion float with gore.'"\n\n[Root.GetFirstName], [Root.GetTitle] of the Trojans, how you curse both the Achaeans and your son for this travesty! Eris of discord has banished your city to siege, and your armies to the slaughter. Your own child, Pari-zitis, has cursed you! It seems outside of lord Appaliunaš and lady Aparaditi, the gods have conspired against you, and your cities shall surely burn for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW3;"Ankhises prayed with outstretched hands, appeasing the mighty gods with sacrifice: - 'Be gracious, great gods, ward off the threats, spare the devoted!'"\n\nDevoted Ankhises, great punishment you surely will suffer for coming to the aid of your cousin Pariya-muwas. However, your son, Aineías, a child of lady Aparaditi, will surely have his day of triumph, whether it be here, or some land far away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW3;"After they have prayed and swore to fight honorably, Priam says, 'Hear me, Wilusili and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Wilusa: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus, for Zeus and the other immortals alone know which shall fall.'"\n\nWilusili, unlike the Achaeans, have made no pledge. To no man have you offered arms in order to defend a great prize. The bodies you shall lay, and the laying done unto your armies, will not be made to protect honor, but to protect life. The gods conspire against you and your people, and against the great city of Wilusa, and every fiber of your being shall be put against total destruction by the Danaan horde. Now, [Root.GetFirstName], shall you fight against them, or resign to your fate, and let Wilusa crumble?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTATW3;I shall defend Wilusa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW3_TT;As you spend time in the battlefield, you may encounter certain events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW4;I have been laid low by a festering wound. As the bearer of the poisoned arrows of Herakles I now tend my poisoned flesh on the island of Lemnos while my fellow Achaeans abandon me to sickness and decay and press on to Troy. None can resist cruel fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW4;How strange are the gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW5;Tragedy! Leader of the Meliboians Philoktetes has been struck by the venom of a snake! We must leave him on the island of Lemnos to recover, as his smell and wails of pain are unbearable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW5;Alas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW6;As I set upon the soil of the Trojans, their army instantly descends upon us. In the heat of battle, I am struck down by Trojan bronze. As I look around in my final moments, it seems as if I was the first to fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW6;How strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW7;Eager Iólaos son of Iphikles leaps from his trim ship onto the Trojan beach. The mantis foretold that the first Achaean to set foot on the faraway beach will surely perish, and now Iólaos has become the first of the destined dead as he falls in battle against the Trojans. Even now the people call him Protesilaos - The First.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW7;Protesilaos, a long age shall sing your praises...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW8;You have put the town of Lurnessos to the sword, and taken a fair Mysian Lady to warm your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW8;A fine trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW9;Akhilleus has given you a most worthy prize from the spoils of Lurnessos, a fair priestess of Apollon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW9;Akhilleus has sent you a most worthy prize from the spoils of Lurnessos, a fair priestess of Apollon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW9;The lion takes his share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW120;Woe! My brother Agamemnon has passed. Though all is not gloom - in his will he has given me his war spoil, a concubine from Lurnessos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW120;Splendid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW122;Dark news! My concubine for Lurnessos has passed. I shall contact Akhilleus to request he give me his spoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW122;He must comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW10;The priestess of Apollon's father, Khrúses, has requested that his daughter be returned for a prize of gold. There may be consequences for the Achaeans if this offer is refused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW10;One of the priests of Apollon of Lurnessos requested that the priestess of Apollon, Astunome, be returned for a prize of gold. There may be consequences for the Achaeans if this offer is refused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCTW10;One of the priests of Apollon of Lurnessos requested that the priestess of Apollon be returned for a prize of gold. There may be consequences for the Achaeans if this offer is refused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW10;She shall be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW10;She stays. That is war, Trojan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW11;The captains and warriors of the Achaeans have been stricken with sickness, this must be the work of Plague-Bringing Apollon at the request of the wronged priestess. The Silver-Bow rains death upon the Achaeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW11;The god is angry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW12;The seer has spoken, the consort taken in Lurnessos must be returned for the plague to abate. Shame, I love her better even than my own wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW12;Akhilleus must provide me tribute, in one form or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW14;Insolent and lustful [From.GetFirstName] has trodden on my honor and taken my concubine. Wine-sopped [From.GetFirstName] will regret this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTATW14_TT;Your mother Thetis will ask Zeus to punish the Achaeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW15;The Wrath of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW15;Wrathful Akhilleus has left the camp of the Achaeans due to a dispute with [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. Without his mighty strength, the Achaean never be able to pierce the walls of Troy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW15;Woe to the soldiers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW15;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW16;I have received a dream of honeyed words and flattery, surely Father Zeus favors me! And I rushed to get all the Achaeans under arms and bring woe to the Trojans, though I believed it wise to test the resolve of my men first. I announced to the camp that they are allowed to take leave and return to their wives, believing that their will to fight will make them stay. Sadly, only this broke their resolve, and only through the help of Odusseús do the Achaeans stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW20;Menelaos is driven back and disarmed, but before the killing blow can be landed, Pallas Athenâ surrounds him in a cloud of darkness and whisks him away to the safety of the Achaeans camp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW23;Treachery! A Trojan archer has fired an arrow at bold Menelaos and broken the truce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW24;The Achaeans are near the end of their strength, now it is time to earn back the favor of godlike Akhilleus. A delegation is sent, hopefully they will bring him and his men back into the fray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW24;Of all the warlords, I hate him the most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW25;The handpicked messengers of Agamemnon enter my tent, and they speak of the treasure and slaves and land that will be given to me to heal my bruised honor. They mean well, and the treasure is tempting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW25;[From.GetFirstName] has wronged me greatly! I shall stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW25;I cannot be far from battle for too long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW26;“I will be appeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting!” Akhilleus’ furious letter of refusal rings through my head as if he was here. The dejected messengers make their libations and glumly return to their tents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW26;Rage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW27;Praise the gods, swift-footed Akhilleus has swallowed his pride and returned to the fray!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW27;May the Trojans quake with fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW28;The state of the Achaeans fills me with despair, as a last resort I approach Akhilleus and say:
“I feel grief for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives... Let me wear your armor - the Trojans may mistake me for you and quit the field!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW28;Will he say yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW29;Pátroklos comes before you with tears streaming from his eyes. 
“I feel grief for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives... Let me wear your armor - the Trojans may mistake me for you and quit the field!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW29;I may relent, but do not keep all the glory for yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW30;I gird myself in the flashing armor of Akhilleus and make ready to take the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW30;For glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW90;Return of Akhilleus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW90;From a great ship comes the bloodthirsty Murmidónes behind the chariot of... Akhilleus? It must be so, who else could wear that well-made cuirass and peaked helm crested with horse-hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW90;Suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW90;Is it truly he?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW31;In the middle of the battle-fray I see wounded 'Akhilleus' - helpless, disarmed, and his true identity revealed. It is great-hearted Pátroklos! I force my way through the ranks, and when close I strike him with my spear, driving the point right through so that he falls heavily to the ground. The armor of Peleus' son is mine to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW31;Akhilleus could not help you today, Pátroklos...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW32;Death of Pátroklos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW32;"Son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue. Pátroklos has fallen, and-"
Darkness, darkness. I grab the filth and dust of the earth and pour it over my head, with a terrible ragged shout I fall upon the ground and tear away at my clothes and hair with hands twisted into claws. The women of the camp wail and shriek with grief, my cries are heard by Mother Thetis in the depths of the sea, and all of her sister-goddesses weep and beat their breasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW32;He whom I loved as dearly as my own life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW32_TT;Thetis has Haphaistos craft new armor and an ornate shield for your return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW33;Return of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW33;Raging Akhilleus has returned to the fray, his shouts of fury are heard throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW33;Raging and grieving Akhilleus has returned to the fray, his shouts of pain and rage are heard throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW33;Troy will bleed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW33;Apollon protect us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW34;"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them, let us now prepare for battle...”\n
I have made peace with Agamemnon who showers me with gifts, including my lost concubine Briseis. Paying little mind to her, I strap on the new forged gear made for you by strong-handed Hephaistos and head off to battle as Briseis mourns the death of Pátroklos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW34;Entering my camp, I see that Agamemnon has ordered my spoils be returned to me. I have made peace with Agamemnon who sends me gifts, including my lost concubine Briseis. Paying little mind to her, I strap on the new forged gear made for you by strong-handed Hephaistos and head off to battle as Briseis mourns the death of Pátroklos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW34;I will give the Trojans their share of fighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW35;I will not flee. Courage wells up within me as I turn and face terrifying Akhilleus who stalks towards me like a lion. I will ready my spear, and face my doom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW35;May you miss your aim, Akhilleus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW36;His spear poised, tall Hektor rushes towards me filled with battle-fire. I snarl and raise my shield, while he soars towards me like the rushing eagle. Priam’s son will not live to see his children grow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW36;No covenants between men and lions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW91;Death of Hektor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW91;Hektor has been struck down by great Akhilleus! In glorious battle, Akhilleus has slain the Trojan prince, leaving the Dardanoi in grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW91;The prince falls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW91;May he rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW38;"Iron-hearted.... beware... my curse, the god's wrath... Paris and Apollon... death at the Scaean Gates!"\nThen my Myrmidons fell on him, stabbing his corpse ten, twenty times over for every blow he gave to Pátroklos. But it is not enough. I pierce his heels, knot them to rawhide, lash them to my chariot. Fast as the wind my horses fly, dragging his body in the dust across the plain. A great cry rings out on the walls of Ilium -- the mother of Hektor tearing out her hair, Dardan Priam with tears coursing down his face. Lament! Lament! No Trojan can feel a tenth of the agony he has caused me, by taking Pátroklos! I will not suffer his murderer to be mourned before him! I turn my horses to the camps, dragging Hektor's broken body behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW38;Not even in death shall I forget you, my Pátroklos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW39;A figure draws near, the mournful shade of dead Pátroklos.
"You sleep, Akhilleus, and have forgotten me - you loved me living, but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed that I may pass the gates of Hades.”\nI open my arms to embrace him, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanishes as a vapor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW39;I shall carry out his final wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW40;Funeral Games for Pátroklos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW40;The grieving Achaeans burn many hecatombs and prepare the funeral games for my Pátroklos. Chariot-races, boxing, furious wrestling, the foot-race, single combat, archery, and then the throwing of the javelin. I heaps prizes on the winners, but my heart is filled with darkness as I peer at the unwashed body of dead Hektor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW40;The grieving Achaeans burn many hecatombs and prepare the funeral games for poor Pátroklos.

EVTOPTATW40;Good champions all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW41;Hektor's Body;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW41;My house is filled with weeping and lamentation. Hektor, brave Hektor, my most beloved son has been slain and his body is kept as a spoil of war by the abominable Danaans. I prepare a mule-wagon carrying treasures of bronze and gold, and with a trusted driver I make my way to the camp of the relentless Achaeans, guided in the night by the twinkling wings of golden Hermes. I enter the dwelling of Akhilleus, and kiss those terrible bloody hands and beg for the body of my Hektor to be returned.\n“Akhilleus, the wrath of heaven - think on your own father and have compassion upon me.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW41;Wretched man that I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW42;Hektor's Body;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW42;A most strange happening, Priam of Ilion enters my presence and kisses my hands, beseeching me to return the body of his son Hektor. He speaks of my own aged father, and seeing this great king brought to such grief moves me as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW42;I shall grant you this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW42;Leave from this camp. Be glad I have not slain you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW43;Hektor's Body;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW43;Akhilleus looks me in the eyes, the eyes of his enemy, and says, "Vex me, sir, no longer - I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hektor.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW43;His soul shall finally rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW44;Hektor's Body;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW44;Akhilleus pulls his hand away from mind and says, “Mourn as you may for your brave son, you will take nothing by it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW44;Such cruelty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW45;Burial of Hektor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW45;The body of dear Hektor is laid upon the pile of wood and the entire grand pyre is set alight. Days later the flames are quenched with rich and hissing wine, the bones are taken and wrapped in soft robes of purple and laid to rest in the tomb-mound with the other great sons of Ilios.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW45;And so is Hektor, breaker of horses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW46;My arrows will find their mark. Dread Akhilleus, murderer of brother Hektor. As I draw near. Appaliunaš guides my arrows, they pierce the skin of the hero, and carry the poison into his veins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW46;Hektor, you are avenged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW92;Death of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW92;Akhilleus, the greatest warrior of the Achaeans has fallen. The Achaeans lament the death of this troubled hero, the Trojans curse his name and await the vengeful wrath of the Danaans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW92;Will this terrible war ever end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW92;May Troy be safe now he is gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW47;Funeral Games for Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW47;The body of Akhilleus is burned, his ashes and bones mixed with those of beloved Pátroklos and interred in the earth of the Troada. The Achaeans hold another round of funeral games, sacrifices, and the exchange of awards and gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW47;Now for his divine armor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW48;The Armor of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW48;Cunning Odusseús claims the divine armor of my dead cousin Akhilleus for himself, hopefully I can overcome his honeyed words and make my case to the rest of the Achaeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW48;I will not be refused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW48;Mighty Aías claims the divine armor of dead Akhilleus for himself, perhaps with my honeyed words I may make my case to the rest of the Achaeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW48;They do call me the teller-of-tales...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW49;The Armor of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW49;I have proven myself most worthy! Akhilleus' shining armor is mine to take. Though it is uncouth to put on the armor at this time, once I return to my private quarters, I'll see if the breastplate fits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW49;I pity the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW50;The Armor of Akhilleus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW50;Crafty Odusseús has won my dead cousin’s armor by tricks and flattery! Him, that thieving snake, has stolen what is mine by right! I cannot bear this dishonor, this inhuman guile! Liar, LIAR!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW50;Aías nevermore shall they insult... Farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBTW50;Maybe I am overreacting a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW117;Suicide of Aías;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW117;Woe to the family of Aías! After Odusseús won the armor of Akhilleus, he fell on his own sword and took his own life. May he find peace in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW117;Great wrath befell him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW51;We have captured the prophetic son of Priam named Helenos, who under torture reveals a most interesting prophecy. “If the bones of Pelops are brought to Troy, if the poisoned arrows of Herakles are held by your captains, if Púrrhos son of Akhilleus fights for you, and if the Palladion which had fallen from heaven is stolen from the city, Troy will finally fall to the Achaeans.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW53;For Troy to fall, the ivory shoulder of Grandfather Pelops must be brought to the Troada, the arrows and bow of Herakles must be held in Troy, the sacred Palladion of Ilios must be stolen, and Púrrhos must fight for us at Ilion. I will send our most trusted companions to complete this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW53;Closer and closer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW76;Envoys of the House of Atreus have arrived at my gates I am told, demanding the stout bones of their ancestor Pelops. They speak of prophecy, seers, and Troy burning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW76;I will give it to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW77;Grandfather Pelops bones have been retrieved, we are another step closer to taking this doomed city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW55;The mission to the city of Troy has returned with the Palladion in tow. Soon Troy will fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW55;I shall see too it that the city will never rise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW56;Terrible news, the precious wooden totem fashioned by Atina has been taken by the Achaeans. We have lost a most valuable ward, will our walls still keep out the foe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW56;We must be more vigilant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW57;We set off for the island of Lemnos to take the poisoned arrows of godly Herakles, left behind on the isle with the unfortunate Philoktetes. In a cave within the Lemnian forests I find the forlorn Philokteces still nursing his festering and desiccated leg laying upon a rustic bed of leaves. Leaning against the cave-wall behind him are the deadly arrows of Herakles, still dripping with the Hydra’s venom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW57;We shall have him healed and returned to the camp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW58;While I lay in Lemnos tending to my still festering wound, I see Diomedes' and Odusseús' ship arrive on the island. They inform me that I am desperately needed in Troy, and that they will have me healed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW60;We set off for the mainland to the realm of the holder of the poisoned arrows of Herakles we find its holder outside of a palace, relaxing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTATW62;He is the image of his father...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW64;Púrrhos has come to the Troada, burning with the battle-fire that belonged to his doomed father Akhilleus. He demands vengeance for his father, and we will let him have it when the time is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTATW64;Let flow the warm blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW65;As I fire my arrows outside of the battlements of the Trojan Walls, I spot an archer taking aim at me. I began to scuttle the other way in order to avoid the arrow, but it is too late. The arrow, seemingly poisoned, strikes my heel, and begins to kill me instantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW65;So this is the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW66;Pure inspiration, a brilliant and cunning plan has been devised by me! The Achaeans are to make a great wooden horse which inside will hide their bravest captains and the rest of the host will burn the camp and sail away. The Trojans will take the carved horse as a votive offering and pull it within their walls, unknowingly bringing their own destruction down on their heads!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW66;A thing of guile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW67;'The Trojan Horse';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW67;[From.GetFirstName] has devised a brilliant plan for our troops to breach the Trojan Walls. A great wooden horse which inside will hide their bravest captains and the rest of the host will burn the camp and sail away. The Trojans will take the carved horse as a votive offering and pull it within their walls, unknowingly bringing their own destruction down on their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW67;We will choose its passengers by lots...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW94;The craftsmen and warriors of the Danaans work tirelessly under the leadership of our greatest architect to build a deadly horse, within its cavernous depths it will carry the doom of the Trojans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW94;Will it work?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW95;It is complete, the great wooden horse towers over plains higher then the walls of Ilios itself. The host of the Achaeans will feign a retreat and wait for the Trojans to fall for the treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW95;We are committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTATW60;The Trojan Horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW68;It is complete, the great wooden horse towers over plains higher then the walls of Ilios itself. The host of the Achaeans will feign a retreat and wait for the Trojans to fall for the treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW68;It will soon be over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW69;Danaans Bearing Gifts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW69;Have we finally earned Father Zeus’ favor? The camp of the vile Danaans is empty, their ships have departed. On the plain they have left what must be a votive offering, a massive wooden horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW69;An offering? Perhaps they fear the offended the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW70;Danaans Bearing Gifts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW70;A wooden horse... who knows what awaits within its cavernous holds? This must be a tool of the Achaeans to take our city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW70;I trust not Danaans, even when they leave gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW71;Danaans Bearing Gifts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW71;Laokoön of Dardania announces his suspicion of the wooden horse. “Do you think the enemy's sailed away? Do you think the Danaans are free of treachery? Trojans, don't trust this horse. Whatever it is, I am afraid of Danaans even those bearing gifts.” He hurls a spear into the horse’s wooden flank to prove his point, it rings out like a hollow chest. As if in answer to this, two massive serpents rise from the sea and coil themselves around proud Laokoon. He collapses, bellowing up to heaven like a dying bull as the serpents sink their teeth again and again into his venom soaked flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW71;The gods have made their point, we must keep the wooden horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW72;In the Belly of the Beast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW72;Laying await until sundown when the Trojans will be at their weakest, some of us begin to have their resolves weakened. However, inspirational words seemingly from Athenâ herself spill from our captains, assuring us in the inevitability of victory. As the sun fell and the moon rose, we poured out of the horse and onto the streets of Troy, destroying its walls and razing the city to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW72;And thus... it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW74;The Sack of Troy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW74;Ilios burns. The whole host of the Achaeans with reckless battle-lust poured into the city. Palaces, temples, horribly blazing on all sides - glowed the Danaan hearts with joy. Ares maddened them: blood runs in torrents, drenched was all the earth, as Trojans and their allies died. All about the city, dolorous howls of strong men stricken to death rose, mixed with the terror-shrieks of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW74;Wilusa burns. The whole host of the Achaeans with reckless battle-lust poured into the city. Palaces, temples, horribly blazing on all sides - glowed the Danaan hearts with joy. Ares maddened them: blood runs in torrents, drenched was all the earth, as Trojans and their allies died. All about the city, dolorous howls of strong men stricken to death rose, mixed with the terror-shrieks of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCTW74;Troy burns. The whole host of the Achaeans with reckless battle-lust poured into the city. Palaces, temples, horribly blazing on all sides - glowed the Danaan hearts with joy. Ares maddened them: blood runs in torrents, drenched was all the earth, as Trojans and their allies died. All about the city, dolorous howls of strong men stricken to death rose, mixed with the terror-shrieks of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW74;Save some spoils for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW74;Merciless are the Danaans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACTW74;The barbarity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW75;Seeing Her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATW75;I press on into the palace dealing merciless death to foes, for maddened is my soul with jealousy. At last in the inner chamber I find my cowering wife, and my bold heart is blackened with rage as I pull her from the midst of the cushions and toss her down at my feet. \nBut, but... As if Aphrodite herself had stayed my sword I was gripped by the beauty which shone as pure as it had the last day I had seen her some ten years before. Helen, Helen, daughter of Zeus, my wedded wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW75;Away from the chaos in Troy, I await my wife's return with much anxiety. As one of my men presents her to me, I am struck with many things, happiness, rage, and awe. She is still as radiant as she was ten years ago. Helen, Helen, daughter of Zeus, my wedded wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW75;Helen, I will forgo wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW75;You have ruined me forever, Helen! Too many lie dead for your sake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW78;In the burning palace bestrewn with dying men and rapacious Achaeans I find him, Priam, lord of the Troada, father of the Dardanoi. He speaks, “Oh, if only your dread father Akhilleus had slain me in his camp so I would not live to see this day, my house and seed are lost forever. Fierce-hearted son of Akhilleus strong in war, slay me, and pity not my misery.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW78;Gladly I fulfill this wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW79;Surrounded by the destruction of my city, I see Púrrhos, sword in hand and ready to strike me down. I cry out to him, begging him to release me from the pain of losing my sons and my city, and he obliges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW79;My line ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW80;With the blood of Trojans on my sword, I feel like a lion, a god even. In the temple of Athenâ I find her, the weird and prophetic daughter of Priam. Kassandra clings to the wooden statue of the grey-eyed goddess and begs for mercy. She will not get it from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW80;With those wooden eyes watching I will take her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW80;I shall respect a woman of Athenâ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW81;All is lost. They would never listen, they couldn’t. The city is falling and I have taken refuge within the temple of Atina. He finds me, the Achaean they call Aías the Lesser, it is all familiar, I knew this day would come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW81;I must not weep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW82;A vapor, an apparition, the shade of my father Akhilleus stands before me with burning dead eyes. \n“Hail, glorious son. Do not grieve for me, death offers me that peace I never knew in life. I need but one offering from you. That seed of Priam, the maiden Polyxena, you must take her to the mound where the bones of Pátroklos and myself were lowered into the earth. Take her life, spill her blood upon my resting place. Or else my wrath will be stirred once again, and none of the Danaans will see their homeland.” \nHe vanishes with the wind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW82;Hark, Argives! Find the girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW82;I cannot sacrifice a human, not even for my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW83;I have been taken by the Danaans from the burning city, who announce their intentions to sacrifice me upon the bones of their departed hero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW83;I am afraid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW84;Polyxena daughter of Priam is carried out of the madness and slaughter of fallen Troy by a troop of blood smeared Achaeans. With glittering armor, like grinning furys howling and chanting and staggering around like drunk men. They hold the girl over the buried bones of Akhilleus and Pátroklos and raggedly open her white throat with a blade of bronze. Blood spills onto the earth and feet of the Achaeans who splash and shout out curses and prayers. Akhilleus will notice this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW84;Hear our prayer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW97;Death of Helen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW97;Helen daughter of Zeus has perished, either from sickness or treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW97;Tragic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW97;The Trojans shall pay for this ten-fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW97;She is dead, burning Troy cannot change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW98;End of the Trojan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW98;With the death of Helen, the captains of the Achaeans have disbanded and returned to their homes. None see the purpose of continuing this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW98;I can finally return to my wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW98;Thank Appaliunaš!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACTW98;A thousand ships return to their harbors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW99;End of the Trojan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW99;Great Ilos still stands in Wilusa. The Trojan War has ended with an uneasy peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW99;An unsatisfying end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW99;At least the city still stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACTW99;Was it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETW100;End of the Trojan War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTW100;The Trojans have crushed the ranks of the Achaeans, the poets will sing of the proud Kings of Wilusa who beat back the vicious Danaans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATW100;Unending shame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABTW100;Appaliunaš protects event from the wrath of Ziuš;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACTW100;Who could have foreseen this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW107;In the city of Troy, I have taken great joy in burning the city to the ground and gathering spoils of war. However, the Trojan princes see me, and rush with their arms to strike me down. After and ardous battle, I reign victorious, however I succumb to my wounds shortly after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW107;This is the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW108;Seeing Akhilleus take pleasure in the destruction of our city, I and other Trojan princes rush to end his reign of terror. After an ardous battle, we are struck down, though Akhilleus is gravely wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW108;May you succumb to your wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW109;Away from the ravaging of Troy, I believe myself safe, until a radiant warrior challenges me to a duel. After fighting with the warrior for some time, I realize it is not a man, but Apollon, who strikes me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW109;Only a god is able to kill me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATW118;As the Danaans destroy my city, they also slaughter its inhabitants. Although I thought myself safe, a group of Danaans found and slew me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBTW118;As the Danaans destroy the city, they also slaughter its inhabitants. Although I thought myself safe, a group of Danaans found and slew me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW118;And thus, I die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW101;On the plain of battle before the walls of Ilios, I see Glaukos, the captain of the Lukians. I speak to him of Oineús, my grandfather, close friend to his own grandfather Bellerophon slayer of the Khímaira.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW101;Let us avoid one anothers spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW101;He is the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW102;On the plain of battle before the walls of Ilios, I see godlike Diomedes, a captain of the Achaeans. I speak to him of Bellerophon slayer of the Khímaira, my grandfather, close friend to his own grandfather Oineús.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW102;Let us avoid one anothers spears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW102_TT;You and Diomedes exchange armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTW102;He is the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW103;Glaukos and I spring from our chariots, clasp hands, and exchange our armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW103;Friendship can grow, even on a battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW104;Glaukos has refused the hand of friendship offered by me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATW104;Pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTW105;The items needed for Troy to fall have been returned to their original owners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTATW105;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
