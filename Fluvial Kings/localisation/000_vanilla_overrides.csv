#Laws#

ze_administration_laws_0_option;Oligarchic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_0_desc;An oligarchic society is a hierarchy of local rulers and their court, where each person in the system owes fealty to those directly above and commands those directly below. It is the way most smaller states work, and it means that the ruler depends greatly on the loyalty of [Player.GetHerHis] more powerful vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ze_administration_laws_1;Stately Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_1_option;Stately;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_1_desc;Royal lords realize the importance of keeping the inheritance together to facilitate their dynasty's long-term increase in power and wealth. In this system, the royal court and family are the primary conduit for which the realm is governed. It is understood that the monarch is a regent of the Divine and and thus their offsprings should succeed them, though that may not always be possible or practical. The warrior-aristocrats and palace scribes in the council greatly favor the strength of their lord. As a result the armies they field wield a zeal for their liege, but provincial lords scoff at the lost of their autonomy and there is a tendency for vassals to grow more and more restless with time if not kept in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ze_administration_laws_2;Hegemonic Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_2_option;Hegemonic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_2_desc;This system of administration is the natural state of all empires. From the river banks of the Nile to the rough mountains of Anatolia, these kings of kings utilize a hierarchy of magistrates and functionaries running daily business in their name. It allows for a power structure that hands less power to permanently landed vassals, though this causes said vassals to resent their liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ze_administration_laws_3;Palatial Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_3_option;Palatial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_3_desc;Palatial societies are based entirely upon the central palace and its bureaucracy. The palace complex manages all affairs of the realm, with smaller cities existing to serve it. This system is highly centralized, which lends itself both a rich state and a disgruntled set of vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ze_administration_laws_4;Politan Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_4_option;Politan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ze_administration_laws_4_desc;A politan society is one in which power is controlled within a major settlement. There is a great deal of variety of the types of rulership of governance within a politan structure - from monarchy to oligarchy to democracy - however all are alike in their scope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC6352;I had repeatedly questioned my servant about the locked mausoleum beneath the citadel but it wasn't until today that I found the key, hidden inside a rotting chest in the oldest citadel tower. Inside the tomb's dusty passageways I found an empty stone coffin which bore the inscription '[Root.GetFirstName] [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6357;I steered the longboat through the raging waters towards the monstrous creature. It stood as tall as a citadel tower, with the body of a man and the head of a great tentacled beast. I knew that I had awoken it from where it slept beneath the waves and that it was here to end the age of man. There was only one thing I could do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WOL_10300;You wake up and go to the window to greet the sun, and then suddenly realize that your citadel garden has been neglected for years and turned into an overgrown and chaotic disgrace. The weeds are knee-high and vines are making it almost impassible without having a sword at hand. Something needs to be done about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WoL_12001;An architect has been brought before your court with a proposal. With your blessing, he will oversee the construction of a new citadel in [From.GetName].

EVTDESC_WoL_12004;Your guards caught the architect hired to build your citadel in [FromFrom.GetName] trying to abscond with the gold you gave him.

EVTDESC_WoL_12005;The construction of your new citadel in [FromFrom.GetName] has been hampered by delays and material shortages.

EVTDESC_ZE_4040;You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your [Root.GetMarshalName] asked you to sponsor.
